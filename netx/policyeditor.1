.SH NAME

policyeditor - view and modify security policy settings for
.B javaws
and the browser plugin

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B policyeditor
.br
.B policyeditor [-file]
policy_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B policyeditor
is a command line program to view and edit applet security policy settings
used by the icedtea-web implementation of
.B javaws
and the browser plugin. It is intended as a simpler, easier to use, and more
accessible alternative to the standard JDK Policy Tool. Administrators and
power users who need fine grained control over policy files should probably
use Policy Tool instead of PolicyEditor.

If executed without any arguments, no file is opened, and saving the file will
result in a prompt on where to save it. Otherwise, if a file path is given as
a command line argument, then that file path will be opened and parsed as a
policy file.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
-file
Specifies a policy file path to open. If this is not given as an argument, the
first argument given is interpreted as a file path to open anyway. This switch
exists mostly for compatibility with Policy Tool.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
policyeditor
Show the GUI editor

.TP
policyeditor -file $HOME/.config/icedtea-web/security/java.policy
Opens the default user-level policy file location


.SH FILES

$HOME/.config/icedtea-web/security/java.policy the default user-level policy file location
