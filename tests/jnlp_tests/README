Each file in directory simple must follows naming convention and is compiled/jared automatically into server's working directory and content of resources likewise. The name of jnlp is independent, and there can be even more jnlps for each future jar.  Files in advanced directory have to care about themselves, but even those can have some parts inside simple directory, so some parts of them are processed automatically.  There are three reproducers – simpletest1, simpletest2 and deadlocktest, which tests test’s suite itself and serve as examples of behaviour.
